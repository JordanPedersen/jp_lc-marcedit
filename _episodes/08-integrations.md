# Compiling marc files
We could save, but that would not protect our .mrc file extension (it would change to marcedit's .mrk extension), nor our UTF8 formatting. To protect these, we will need to go to file, compile to marc8

# Extract 
Exercise to extract all the Adam Matthew records 

# Marc Join
Join Mcwhinney to the non-Adam Matthew records.
